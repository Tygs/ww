- **Compatibility:** CPython 2.7+/3.3+ and the last stable versions of pypy2.
- **Platform:** Agnostic. But only tested on GNU/Linux for now.
- **Version:** 0.2
- `Documentation`_.

**Install with**::

  pip install ww


Ever wish you could...
------------------------

lazily slice generators?

::

    >>> from ww import g
    >>> gen = g(x * x for x in range(100))
    >>> gen
    <IterableWrapper generator>
    >>> for element in g(x * x for x in range(100))[3: 6]:
    ...     print(element)
    ...
    9
    16
    25

add dictionaries?

::

    >>> from ww import d
    >>> dic = d({'a': 1})
    >>> dic
    {'a': 1}
    >>>  dic + {'b': 2}
    {'b': 2, 'a': 1}

have a `len` attribute on lists?

::

    >>> from ww import l
    >>> lst = l([1, 2, 3])
    >>> lst
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> lst.len
    3

`join()` from tuple?

::

    >>> from ww import t
    >>> tpl = t((1, 2, 3))
    >>> tpl
    (1, 2, 3)
    >>> tpl.join(',')  # oh, it also autocasts to string. And its configurable.
    u'1,2,3'

`replace()` multiple caracters at once in a string?

::

    >>> from ww import s
    >>> string = s('fizz buzz')
    >>> string  # strings try very hard to be consistent on Python 2 and 3
    u'fizz buzz'
    >>> string.replace(('i', 'u'), 'o')  # the original signature is ok too
    u'fozz bozz'

And there are many, many, more goodies.


WARNING
--------

The software is currently in early stage. Only s() and g() are considered
well documented and tested, and even them deserve some more love.
You'll also meet some empty files for future ideas.

We choose to make an early release under the pressing request of colleagues
eager to try it but it's not the final product. Quality is on the way.

Also, we WILL break the API until we reach 1.0, from which we'll switch
to semver and secure the API.


Development
------------

You can offer PR with your contributions to ww. They should include unit tests,
docstrings, type definitions and a new entry in the documentation. And
follow the style conventions:

 - Python: `PEP8`_
 - Docstrings: `Google style`_

Get the full repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Tygs/ww.git

And move inside the ww directory.

Install ww and the dependancies for dev::

    python setup.py develop
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Deactivate dev mode:

    python setup.py develop --uninstall

Running unit tests on your current Python::

    python setup.py test

Run tests coverage with your current Python::

    # cmd only coverage
    py.test --cov ww tests
    # dump an HTML report in htmlcov dir
    py.test  --cov-report html --cov ww tests

We have many test environements to build the doc, validate the code against
various checkers and linters or run unit tests on several Python interpreters.

You can list them all with::

     tox -l

E.G::

    $ tox -l
    flake8
    py35
    py34
    py33
    py27
    pypy2
    doc
    coverage
    mypy
    bandit

You can run them individually with::

    tox -e env_name

E.G:

    tox -e doc # builds the documentation

All envs with a name starting with "py" requires that you have the matching
Python interpreter installed on your system to be ran.

E.G: py33 requires you to have CPython 3.3 installed on your machine, and pypy2
 supposes you have PyPy2 on your machine.

The mypy, bandit and doc env require you to have Python3.5 installed.

Running all the tests in all envs can be done with:

    tox

Before you do a PR, it's better if you can do this, since it will run the
the most tests. But remember if you don't have the matching interpreters
they will be skipped.

In any case, running the checkers and linters is strongly advised, as any PR
failing them will be rejected.

Versioning scheme
------------------

Versioning follow `SemVer`_, althoug we won't commit to stability before version 1.0.

Release with X.Y.Z will be of 2 kinds:

- if Y is odd, the release will add features.
- if Y is even or Z > 0, the release will be dedicated to bug fixing,
  documentation, API improvment and performances.

E.G.:

- 0.2.1: 1 > 0 so no new features.
- 1.4.1: 4 is even, so no new features.
- 2.1.0: 1 is odd, you may see new feature in this release.
